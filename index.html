<h2 id="whitered">Safety</h3>
<p id="leftalign"> In order to ensure the safety of every individual during the event, OCBC has come up with several guidelines and precautions for everyone to follow. They ask that participants come an hour before the official start time of the ride. One of the key reasons for this extra hour is to allow for security checks to be conducted. </p>

<p id="leftalign">Below are some of the safety measures in place:</p>
<ol id="leftalign">
<li>Participation will be capped at 7,000 to reduce congestion</li>
<li>Taller and bigger cones will be used for better visibility on the route</li>
<li>Route marshals will be equipped with light sticks for better visibility</li>
<li>More paramedics and route marshals will be deployed</li>
<li>The event’s emergency hotline number will be printed on every participant’s bib, helmet stickers and bike tag for reference</li>
<li>Safety signs will be prominently displayed along the route</li>
<li>Selfie Points will be designated on the route for photo-taking</li>
<li>Additional security checks will be carried out</li>
</ol>
<p id="leftalign">To prevent any security compromises or potential threats, we cannot divulge the full details of our security plan to the public. We are working with the relevant authorities to implement all the necessary safety and security measures.

Participants are encouraged to stay hydrated at all times before, during and after your rides. There will be hydration stations located at the start point, on the route as well as the finish point.</p>
